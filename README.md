# Welcome to Recordz!

## View Your Collection

## Edit / Add / Delete
* You'll have full control over your record collection here. Sold something? delete it. Made a particularly fruitful trip to the record store? Add the new wax here. Decide that Bob Dylan is more rock n' roll than folk? update away.

## See your album art in all of it's original 12" glory!
* Vinyl is meant to be seen, felt, grasped in your hands and dissected. Here at Recordz we take this experience very seriously. We've tried to replicate that feeling by displaying you albums art first, and when clicked they will flip over revealing all other desirable information through the power of the Discogs API.
