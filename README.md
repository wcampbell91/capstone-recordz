# Welcome to Recordz!

## RNDM Pick
* Randomly pick a record from your collection when you're feeling lazy, but want to be reminded of a record lost in the deep dark recesses of your collection.

## View Your Collection
* Powered by the Discogs API, Recordz will show you your albums in all their 12" glory with album art front and center. And With a few clicks, you can dig deeper to find out more about your favorite record or artist.

## Edit / Add / Delete
* You'll have full control over your record collection here. Sold something? delete it. Made a particularly fruitful trip to the record store? Add the new wax here. Decide that Bob Dylan is more rock n' roll than folk? update away.

## See your album art in all of it's original 12" glory!
* Vinyl is meant to be seen, felt, grasped in your hands and dissected. Here at Recordz we take this experience very seriously. We've tried to replicate that feeling by displaying you albums art first, and when clicked they will flip over revealing all other desirable information through the power of the Discogs API.
